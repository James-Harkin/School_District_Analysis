# School_District_Analysis
## Overview:
The freshmen at Thomas High School were caught cheating. Maria has a dataset of stutent data that she needs to remove the freshmen scores and recalculate the overall scores. Her job is also to keep the rest of the data in tact and note the changes.<br>

After removing the freshmen scores, the school's overall passing percentages needed to be recalculated. <br>

# Summary:
If the percentage of overall passing students is how you rank schools, this could have put Thomas High School lower on the list; however it did not. By removing the freshmen students from calculations, the school on paper had a higher percentage of failing students. Thomas was one of the highest rated schools. Above them in the rank Cabrera High School	had 91.33% passing students. And below Thomas is Griffin High School with 90.59%. So even after the change Thomas holds second place in this data sheet.
